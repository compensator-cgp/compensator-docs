# Delegation

## How to Delegate

Delegation is the process of allocation COMP token voting power to delegates. All COMP token holders are eligible to delegate COMP tokens to community delegates and earn rewards. Only delegates who have completed their profile setup at the [Interface](https://compensator.io/profile) are eligible to offer rewards to delegators.
