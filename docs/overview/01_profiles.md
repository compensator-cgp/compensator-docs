# Profiles

Profiles are the foundation of Compensator's delegate marketplace. Every user has a dedicated page that enables them to create a Compensator instance and establish their presence in the Compound ecosystem.

### What is a Profile?

A profile serves as your identity and operational hub in Compensator, allowing you to:
- **Establish Identity**: Create your delegate persona and reputation
- **Configure Rewards**: Set reward rates, username, and more for delegators
- **Deploy Smart Contracts**: Set up your Compensator instance for reward distribution
- **Manage Operations**: Handle delegations, rewards, and governance participation

## Profile Components

### Core Profile Elements

1. **Personal Information**: Name, description, and contact details
2. **Wallet Address**: Your Ethereum address for transactions
3. **Reward Configuration**: Rate and terms for delegator compensation
4. **Smart Contract Instance**: Your deployed Compensator contract
5. **Voting History**: Track record of governance participation

### Smart Contract Integration

Your profile is connected to a Compensator instance that:
- **Manages Delegations**: Handles incoming vote power allocations
- **Distributes Rewards**: Automatically pays delegators based on configured rates
- **Tracks Performance**: Records voting history and delegate metrics
- **Ensures Transparency**: Provides verifiable on-chain data

## How to Setup Your Profile

### Prerequisites

Before creating your profile, ensure you have:

1. **COMP Tokens**: Sufficient COMP tokens for reward pool funding
2. **Web3 Wallet**: A connected wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
3. **Ethereum Network**: Access to the correct Ethereum network
4. **Gas Fees**: ETH for transaction costs (3 transactions required)

### Step 2: Configure Information

Enter your profile details:

**Required Information:**
- **Name**: Your delegate name (will be displayed publicly)

</p> -->

### Step 3: Set Reward Configuration

Configure your reward structure:

**Reward Rate:**
- Choose your annual reward rate (e.g., 1.5%, 2.0%, 3.0%)
- Consider market rates and your competitive position
- Higher rates attract more delegators but reduce your earnings

**Reward Pool Funding:**
- Determine how much COMP to deposit for rewards
- Consider your expected delegation volume
- Plan for ongoing funding needs

### Step 4: Deploy Smart Contract

The profile setup requires 3 transactions:

**Transaction 1: Profile Creation**
- Creates your profile on the platform
- Establishes your delegate identity

**Transaction 2: Instance Deployment**
- Deploys your smart contract instance
- Sets up reward distribution mechanisms

**Transaction 3: Reward Pool Funding**
- Deposits COMP tokens into your reward pool
- Enables automatic reward distribution

  <em>Three-step smart contract deployment process</em>
</p> -->

### Step 5: Verify Setup

After completing all transactions:

1. **Check Profile Status**: Verify your profile is active
2. **Confirm Contract Deployment**: Ensure your Compensator instance is deployed
3. **Test Reward Pool**: Verify your COMP tokens are properly deposited
4. **Review Public Profile**: Check how your profile appears to potential delegators
