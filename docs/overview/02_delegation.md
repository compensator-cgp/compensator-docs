# Delegation

Delegation is the core mechanism that powers the Compensator marketplace. By delegating your COMP holdings, you can participate in governance while earning rewards from delegates who offer compensation.

### What is Delegation?

Delegation allows COMP holders to allocate voting power to delegates who vote on their behalf. This enables:

- **Passive Participation**: Vote without actively monitoring every proposal
- **Reward Earning**: Receive COMP tokens from delegates who offer rewards
- **Flexible Control**: Maintain full control over your tokens while delegating
- **Expert Guidance**: Leverage the expertise of experienced delegates

## Prerequisites

Before you can delegate your COMP tokens, ensure you have:

1. **COMP Tokens**: You must hold COMP tokens in your wallet
2. **Connected Wallet**: A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) connected
3. **Ethereum Network**: Ensure you're on the Ethereum Mainnet network

## How to Delegate

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Visit [compensator.io](https://compensator.io)
2. Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top nav
3. Select your preferred wallet provider
4. Approve the connection request

### Step 2: Browse Delegates

1. Navigate to the "Delegates" section
2. Browse available delegates and their profiles
3. Review delegate information including:
   - Voting history and track record
   - Reward rates and terms
   - Proposal analysis and reasoning
   - Communication channels

### Step 3: Select a Delegate

1. Click on a delegate's profile to view detailed information
2. Review their:
   - **Reward Rate**: Percentage of COMP tokens offered as rewards
   - **Voting History**: Past proposals and voting decisions
   - **Proposal Analysis**: Detailed reasoning for their votes
   - **Terms**: Any specific conditions or requirements

### Step 4: Delegate Your Tokens

1. Click the "Delegate" button on the delegate's profile
2. Enter the amount of COMP tokens you want to delegate
3. Review the transaction details including:
   - Reward rate
   - Gas fees
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

### Step 5: Monitor Your Delegation

After successful delegation, you can:

1. **Track Rewards**: Monitor accrued rewards in real-time
2. **View Voting Activity**: See how your delegate votes on proposals
3. **Manage Delegation**: Modify or withdraw your delegation at any time
4. **Claim Rewards**: Withdraw earned COMP tokens

## Important Considerations

### Reward Eligibility

- Only delegates who have completed their profile setup at the [Interface](https://compensator.io/profile) are eligible to offer rewards
- Delegations to non-setup delegates go directly to their wallet (not through Compensator)
- Delegates without a Compensator instance will have a 0.00% reward rate

### Security Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with smaller delegations to test the system
2. **Research Delegates**: Always review a delegate's history and reputation
3. **Monitor Activity**: Regularly check your delegate's voting behavior
4. **Diversify**: Consider delegating to multiple delegates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Transaction Fails**
- Ensure you have sufficient ETH for gas fees
- Check that you're on the correct Ethereum network
- Verify your wallet is properly connected

**No Rewards Appearing**
