# Delegation

Delegation is the core mechanism that powers the Compensator marketplace. By delegating your COMP holdings, you can participate in governance while earning rewards from delegates who offer compensation.

### What is Delegation?

Delegation allows COMP holders to allocate voting power to delegates who vote on their behalf. This enables:

- **Passive Participation**: Vote without actively monitoring every proposal
- **Reward Earning**: Receive COMP tokens from delegates who offer rewards
- **Flexible Control**: Maintain full control over your tokens while delegating
- **Expert Guidance**: Leverage the expertise of experienced delegates

1. **COMP Tokens**: You must hold COMP tokens in your wallet
2. **Connected Wallet**: A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) connected
3. **Ethereum Network**: Ensure you're on the Ethereum Mainnet network

## Important Considerations

### Reward Eligibility

- Only delegates who have completed their profile setup at the [Interface](https://compensator.io/profile) are eligible to offer rewards
- Delegations to non-setup delegates go directly to their wallet (not through Compensator)
- Delegates without a Compensator instance will have a 0.00% reward rate

### Security Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with smaller delegations to test the system
2. **Research Delegates**: Always review a delegate's history and reputation
3. **Monitor Activity**: Regularly check your delegate's voting behavior
4. **Diversify**: Consider delegating to multiple delegates
