# Delegation

Delegation is the core mechanism that powers the Compensator marketplace. By delegating your COMP holdings, you can participate in governance while earning rewards from delegates who offer compensation.

## What is Delegation?

Delegation allows COMP holders to allocate voting power to delegates who vote on their behalf. This enables:

- **Passive Participation**: Vote without actively monitoring every proposal
- **Reward Earning**: Receive COMP tokens from delegates who offer rewards
- **Flexible Control**: Maintain full control over your tokens while delegating
- **Expert Guidance**: Leverage the expertise of experienced delegates

## Prerequisites

- **COMP Tokens**: You must hold COMP tokens in your wallet
- **Connected Wallet**: A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) connected
- **Ethereum Network**: Ensure you're on the Ethereum Mainnet network

## How to Delegate

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Visit the Compensator platform
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top navigation
3. Select your preferred wallet provider
4. Approve the connection request

### Step 2: Browse and Select Delegate

1. Navigate to "Explore" section to view available delegates
2. Review delegate profiles and information
3. Click on a delegate's profile for detailed information

### Step 3: Delegate Your Tokens

1. Click the "Delegate" button on the delegate's profile page
2. Enter the amount of COMP tokens you want to delegate
3. Review and confirm the transaction in your wallet
4. Wait for blockchain confirmation

### Step 4: Monitor Your Delegation

After successful delegation:
- View your delegation in the delegate's profile
- Track changes to your delegation status
- Manage delegation through Compound's native system

## Current Implementation

The delegation system provides:
- **Basic Delegation**: Direct delegation using Compound's native delegation
- **Delegate Discovery**: Browse available delegates through the explore page
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect Web3 wallets and manage COMP balances
- **Transaction Handling**: Submit delegation transactions to the blockchain

## Important Considerations

### Delegation Mechanics

- Delegations use Compound's native delegation system
- Your COMP tokens remain in your wallet but voting power is transferred
- You can change your delegation at any time
- Delegations are not locked and can be modified freely

### Security Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with smaller delegations to test the system
2. **Research Delegates**: Always review a delegate's address and reputation
3. **Monitor Activity**: Regularly check your delegate's voting behavior
4. **Verify Addresses**: Double-check delegate addresses before delegating

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Transaction Fails**: Ensure sufficient ETH for gas fees and verify you're on Ethereum Mainnet
- **Delegation Not Showing**: Refresh page, reconnect wallet, or check transaction status on Etherscan
- **Wallet Connection Issues**: Clear browser cache, update wallet extension, or try refreshing the page
