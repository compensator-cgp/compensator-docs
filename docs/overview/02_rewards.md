# Rewards

## How to Claim

Delegator rewards accrue in real-time. Rewards are only supported for delegates who have created a Compensator instance through their profile. If they have not, their reward rate will remain at 0.00% and delegations be will direct to their wallet (as opposed to a Compensator instance) until they do so. Claim rewards in the nav. menu by clicking the rewards accrued element near the connect wallet button.
