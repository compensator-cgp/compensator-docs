# Rewards

Rewards are the mechanism that makes Compensator's marketplace thrive. By delegating your COMP tokens to qualified delegates, you can earn additional COMP tokens as compensation for your vote power.

### How Rewards Work

Rewards in Compensator are designed to be:
- **Transparent**: Clear reward rates and terms for all delegates
- **Real-time**: Rewards accrue continuously as you delegate
- **Automatic**: No manual intervention required for reward calculation
- **Secure**: Smart contract-based reward distribution

## Reward Mechanics

### Real-Time Accrual

Rewards accumulate in real-time based on:
- **Delegation Amount**: The quantity of COMP you've delegated
- **Time Delegated**: How long your COMP has been delegated
- **Reward Rate**: The percentage offered by your delegate

## Eligibility Requirements

### Delegate Requirements

For you to earn rewards, your delegate must:

1. **Complete Profile Setup**: Have a fully configured profile at [Compensator.io/profile](https://compensator.io/profile)
2. **Create Compensator Instance**: Deploy their smart contract through the interface
3. **Fund Reward Pool**: Deposit COMP tokens to cover reward payments
4. **Set Reward Rate**: Configure a reward rate greater than 0.00%

### Delegator Requirements

To be eligible for rewards, you must:

1. **Hold COMP Tokens**: Have COMP tokens in your connected wallet
2. **Delegate to Qualified Delegate**: Choose a delegate with a Compensator instance
3. **Maintain Delegation**: Keep your tokens delegated to earn ongoing rewards
