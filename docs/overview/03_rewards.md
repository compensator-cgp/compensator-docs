# Rewards

Rewards are the mechanism that makes Compensator's marketplace thrive. By delegating your COMP tokens to qualified delegates, you can earn additional COMP tokens as compensation for your vote power.

### How Rewards Work

Rewards in Compensator are designed to be:
- **Transparent**: Clear reward rates and terms for all delegates
- **Real-time**: Rewards accrue continuously as you delegate
- **Automatic**: No manual intervention required for reward calculation
- **Secure**: Smart contract-based reward distribution

## Reward Mechanics

### Real-Time Accrual

Rewards accumulate in real-time based on:
- **Delegation Amount**: The quantity of COMP you've delegated
- **Time Delegated**: How long your COMP has been delegated
- **Reward Rate**: The percentage offered by your delegate
