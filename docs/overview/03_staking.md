# Staking

Staking in Compensator is a powerful mechanism that allows COMP holders to incentivize specific vote outcomes. By staking COMP tokens for or against particular proposals, you can directly influence delegate voting behavior.

### What is Staking?

Staking enables you to:
- **Incentivize Outcomes**: Reward delegates for voting your preferred way
- **Risk Management**: Get your stake back if your outcome loses

</p> -->

## Staking Mechanics

### How Staking Works

1. **Proposal Identification**: A governance proposal is created in Compound DAO
2. **Stake Placement**: You stake COMP tokens for your preferred outcome (For/Against)
3. **Delegate Voting**: A delegate votes on the proposal in the aligned direction
4. **Outcome Determination**: The proposal passes or fails based on votes
5. **Stake Distribution**: Stakes are distributed based on the outcome

</p> -->

### Stake Distribution Logic

**If Your Staked Outcome Wins:**
- Your stake is transferred to the delegate who voted correctly
- You achieve your desired outcome and delegate receives compensation

**If Your Staked Outcome Loses:**
- Your stake is returned to you in full
- You maintain your COMP balance

## Prerequisites

### Before You Can Stake

1. **COMP Token Ownership**: You must hold COMP in your wallet
2. **Active Delegation**: You must have delegated COMP to a delegate's Compensator instance
3. **Connected Wallet**: Your Web3 wallet must be connected to the platform
4. **Ethereum Network**: Ensure you're on the correct Ethereum network

## How to Stake

### Step 1: Identify a Proposal

1. Navigate to the "Proposals" section on [Compensator.io](https://compensator.io)
2. Browse active governance proposals
3. Review proposal details including:
   - Proposal description and rationale
   - Current voting status
   - Timeline for voting
   - Potential impact on the ecosystem

</p> -->

### Step 2: Analyze the Proposal

Before staking, thoroughly analyze:
- **Proposal Content**: Understand what the proposal aims to achieve
- **Potential Impact**: Consider how it affects the Compound ecosystem
- **Your Position**: Determine whether you support or oppose the proposal
- **Delegate Alignment**: Check if your delegates share your position

</p> -->

### Step 3: Choose Your Stake Amount

Consider these factors when deciding stake amount:
- **Available COMP**: How much you can afford to stake
- **Proposal Importance**: Higher stakes for more critical proposals
- **Risk Tolerance**: Your comfort level with potential outcomes
- **Delegate Incentive**: Amount needed to meaningfully incentivize delegates

</p> -->

### Step 4: Place Your Stake

1. Click on the proposal you want to stake on
2. Select "For" or "Against" based on your preference
3. Enter the amount of COMP tokens you want to stake
4. Review the transaction details including:
   - Gas fees
   - Stake amount
   - Expected outcome
5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

### Step 5: Monitor Your Stake

After placing your stake:
1. **Track Voting Progress**: Monitor how delegates are voting
2. **Watch Proposal Status**: Follow the proposal through the voting period
3. **Prepare for Outcome**: Understand what happens when voting concludes
4. **Manage Multiple Stakes**: If you have stakes on multiple proposals

### Delegation Requirements

**Critical Requirement**: You must have delegated COMP tokens to a delegate's Compensator instance. This ensures:
- Proper incentive alignment
- Secure transaction processing
- Transparent stake distribution
- Valid governance participation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Transaction Fails**
- Ensure you have sufficient ETH for gas fees
- Verify you have delegated COMP to a Compensator instance
- Check that you're on the correct Ethereum network
- Confirm your wallet is properly connected

**Stake Not Showing**
- Refresh the page and reconnect your wallet
- Check the transaction status on Etherscan
- Verify the proposal is still active
- Contact support if issues persist

**Delegation Requirement Error**
- You must delegate COMP tokens before staking
- Ensure your delegate has a Compensator instance
- Check that your delegation is active and confirmed
- Review the [delegation guide](./delegation) for setup instructions
