# Staking

## How to Stake

COMP token holders may incentivize delegates to vote for or against proposals by staking COMP. After the delegate votes, the stake is distributed based on the outcome. Delegators who staked for the winning option pass their stake to the delegate, thus achieving their desired outcome and delivering compensation. Delegators who staked for the losing option get their stake back, ensuring there is no loss attributable. Stakers must have delegated COMP tokens to a delegate's Compensator instance for transactions to be processed.
