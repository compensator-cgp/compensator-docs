# Profiles

## How to Setup

Every user has a dedicated [profile](https://www.compensator.io/profile) page with the ability to create a Compensator instance (smart contract). The CompensatorFactory and the newly deployed Compensator instance for the user/delegate will be called with provided data (such as name, wallet address, reward rate, and amount to fund rewards in COMP tokens). The process takes 3 transactions through the interaction, to be signed by user/delegate, to reach completion.
