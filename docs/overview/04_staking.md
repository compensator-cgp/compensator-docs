# Staking

Staking in Compensator allows COMP holders to incentivize vote outcomes. By staking COMP holdings for or against particular proposals, holders can directly influence voting behavior transparently and at scale.

## What is Staking?

Staking enables you to:
- **Incentivize Outcomes**: Reward delegates for voting your preferred way
- **Risk Management**: Get your stake back if your outcome loses
- **Governance Participation**: Actively engage in Compound DAO decisions

## Staking Mechanics

### How Staking Works

1. **Proposal Identification**: A governance proposal is created in Compound DAO
2. **Stake Placement**: You stake COMP tokens for your preferred outcome (For/Against)
3. **Delegate Voting**: A delegate votes on the proposal in the aligned direction
4. **Outcome Determination**: The proposal passes or fails based on votes
5. **Stake Distribution**: Stakes are distributed based on the outcome

### Stake Distribution Logic

**If Your Staked Outcome Wins:**
- Your stake is transferred to the delegate who voted correctly
- You achieve your desired outcome and delegate receives compensation

**If Your Staked Outcome Loses:**
- Your stake is returned to you in full
- You maintain your COMP balance

## Prerequisites

- **COMP Token Ownership**: You must hold COMP in your wallet
- **Connected Wallet**: Your Web3 wallet must be connected to the platform
- **Ethereum Network**: Ensure you're on Ethereum Mainnet
- **Active Proposal**: The proposal must be in an active voting state

## How to Stake

### Step 1: Identify and Analyze a Proposal

1. Navigate to the "Proposals" section on the platform
2. Browse active governance proposals
3. Review proposal details including description, voting status, timeline, and potential impact
4. Determine whether you support or oppose the proposal

### Step 2: Choose Your Amount

Consider these factors when deciding stake amount:
- **Available COMP**: How much you can afford to stake
- **Proposal Importance**: Higher stakes for more critical proposals
- **Risk Tolerance**: Your comfort level with potential outcomes
- **Delegate Incentive**: Amount needed to meaningfully incentivize delegates

### Step 3: Place Your Stake

1. Click on the proposal you want to stake on
2. Select "For" or "Against" based on your preference
3. Enter the amount of COMP tokens you want to stake
4. Review transaction details including gas fees and stake amount
5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

### Step 4: Monitor Your Stake

After placing your stake:
- Track voting progress and monitor how delegates are voting
- Watch proposal status through the voting period
- Prepare for outcome and manage multiple stakes if applicable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
